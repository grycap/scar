Testing
===============================================

This folder contains scripts to manually perform the deployment of the SCAR Lambda function. You will need:

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured with a user profile with the appropriate permissions to deploy Lambda functions.

* An IAM Role that provides the Lambda function with proper access credentials to Amazon S3 and publish Logs into Amazon CloudWatch.

You will need to customize the variables to fit your environment.
